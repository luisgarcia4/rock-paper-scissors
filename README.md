This was my initial attempt at The Odin Project's "Rock Paper Scissors" project. The javascript chapter dealt with conditional statements and functions. The appliction works through the alert window and results are recorded under the console log.

UPDATE: I've added a javascript file and a stylesheet to make the game user friendly. The purpose of this project was to implement lessons on functions, conditional statements, and DOM manipulation in vanilla JavaScript. I also added CSS to make the game more visually appealing. Comments on what each function is doing can be found in the JS file.
